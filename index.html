                        <h2>About US</h2>
                        NIT Calicut has a vibrant Alumni of over 30,000 who have been contributing to the development of the institute through various initiatives. The Institute is very proud of its former students now occupying key positions in the country and outside. The Silver Jubilee and Golden Jubilee reunions of REC/NITC is conducted every year in the campus. The Silver Jubilee Endowment Fund, contributed by each batch of alumni while celebrating the Silver Jubilee of their graduation is awarding scholarships worth 10 lakhs each year. This is in addition to the scholarships instituted by individual alumnus. In 2018, during the WNMÂ held in NIT Calicut, the Creative Zone sponsored by NITCAA was inaugurated. Further to this a Gazebo is under construction which is sponsored by the 1969 batch alumni, who recently celebrated their Golden Jubilee. A lot of similar infrastructure and technology projects are expected to come up in the campus, with the support of Alumni. The Distinguished Alumni Lecture series is another way by which alumni give back to the alma mater, where they will be sharing their professional experience with the budding engineers to motivate them. The North America NITC Alumni Association initiated a program called NITC Alumni Mentoring Program (NITCAMP), where current students are mentored by alumni and help them out in selecting career paths. This program has been running successfully since 2017. NITCAA and NITC are together in the process of preparing the alumni database, which will help a lot in augmenting the interactions. The Office of Dean Alumni Affairs and International Relations (AAIR) is extending all the support to NITCAA for fruitful interaction with the alumni. An Agreement was signed between NITC and NITCAA on February 2020 to articulate and execute programmes and projects which provides avenues for meaningful engagement between NITC and its Alumni.
